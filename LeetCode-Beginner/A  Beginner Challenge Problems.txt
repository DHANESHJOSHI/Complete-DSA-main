In this chapter, we will cover some beginner-friendly problems and walk through the steps to solve them. 
This chapter is intended for beginners and will help you get your feet wet and become comfortable with the problem-solving process on LeetCode. 
For those who are already at the level where you can solve medium or hard problems, you can skip to the next chapter.

Note that all video solutions are provided in Java since this is the most common language used on LeetCode. 
The ideas and logic used to solve the problem are the same, so regardless of what 
language you use, you can learn from the video solutions. Understanding code, regardless of the language 
it is written in, is a good skill to build and not as scary of a challenge as it may initially sound. 
In any case, for all of the problems in this chapter, solutions are provided in several popular languages. 
These can be found either in the official solution article or in the discussion section for the problem.
